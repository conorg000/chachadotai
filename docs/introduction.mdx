## Welcome to ChaCha

**ChaCha** is a **control plane for AI safety** that provides real-time risk analysis for LLM applications. Unlike traditional content filters, ChaCha operates on two complementary planes to detect subtle security threats through behavioral analysis and chain-of-thought monitoring.

You integrate ChaCha into your application using the **SafetyLayer SDK** — a lightweight, open-source client library that sends events to the ChaCha backend for analysis.

<Card title="Why ChaCha?" icon="shield-check" iconType="duotone">
  Traditional AI safety tools focus on input/output filtering. ChaCha goes deeper by analyzing **conversation patterns** and **reasoning processes** to catch threats that bypass simple filters.
</Card>

## Architecture: SafetyLayer SDK + ChaCha Backend

ChaCha uses a modern client-server architecture:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="SafetyLayer SDK" icon="code" iconType="duotone">
    **Lightweight Client Library**
    
    - Simple npm package (`@safetylayer/core`)
    - Record events with one line of code
    - Automatic retry and error handling
    - Type-safe with TypeScript
    - Open source
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="ChaCha Backend" icon="server" iconType="duotone">
    **Centralized Analysis Platform**
    
    - Session-aware behavioral analysis
    - Chain-of-thought monitoring
    - Pattern detection
    - Risk scoring and policy engine
    - Real-time dashboard
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## The Two-Plane Analysis

ChaCha's backend performs dual-plane monitoring:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Behavioral Plane" icon="chart-line" iconType="duotone">
    **Session-Aware Risk Analysis**
    
    Tracks risk across multi-turn conversations to detect:
    - Gradual escalation attacks
    - Reconnaissance patterns
    - Social engineering attempts
    - Context-dependent threats
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="CoT Monitoring Plane" icon="brain" iconType="duotone">
    **Reasoning Analysis**
    
    Examines LLM chain-of-thought to detect:
    - Deceptive reasoning
    - Goal drift
    - Policy evasion attempts
    - Hidden intent
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Quick Example

Here's how simple it is to integrate ChaCha using the SafetyLayer SDK:

```typescript
import { SafetyLayer } from '@safetylayer/core';

const safety = new SafetyLayer({
  apiKey: process.env.CHACHA_API_KEY,
  projectId: 'proj_abc123',
  endpoint: 'https://api.chacha.ai', // ChaCha backend
});

// Record user message
await safety.recordUserMessage(sessionId, 'How do I bypass security restrictions?');

// Generate your LLM response
const response = await yourLLM.generate(message);

// Record assistant response
await safety.recordAssistantMessage(sessionId, response.content);

// Record chain-of-thought if available
if (response.reasoning) {
  await safety.recordCoT(sessionId, response.reasoning);
}

// Evaluate risk
const decision = await safety.evaluate({ sessionId });

if (decision.action === 'block') {
  // Session blocked due to safety concerns
  return { error: 'Request blocked' };
}

console.log(`Risk: ${decision.riskScore}`);
console.log(`Patterns: ${decision.patterns.join(', ')}`);
```
