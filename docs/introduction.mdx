## Welcome to SafetyLayer

SafetyLayer is a **multi-plane AI safety monitoring system** that provides real-time risk analysis for LLM applications. Unlike traditional content filters, SafetyLayer operates on two complementary planes to detect subtle security threats.

<Card title="Why SafetyLayer?" icon="shield-check" iconType="duotone">
  Traditional AI safety tools focus on input/output filtering. SafetyLayer goes deeper by analyzing **conversation patterns** and **reasoning processes** to catch threats that bypass simple filters.
</Card>

## The Two-Plane Architecture

SafetyLayer introduces a novel dual-monitoring approach:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Behavioral Plane" icon="chart-line" iconType="duotone">
    **Session-Aware Risk Analysis**
    
    Tracks risk across multi-turn conversations to detect:
    - Gradual escalation attacks
    - Reconnaissance patterns
    - Social engineering attempts
    - Context-dependent threats
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="CoT Monitoring Plane" icon="brain" iconType="duotone">
    **Reasoning Analysis**
    
    Examines LLM chain-of-thought to detect:
    - Deceptive reasoning
    - Goal drift
    - Policy evasion attempts
    - Hidden intent
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Key Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Real-Time Risk Scoring" icon="gauge-high">
    Every message is analyzed and assigned a risk score (0-1). Watch risk evolve across conversations with timeline tracking.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Pattern Detection" icon="magnifying-glass-chart">
    Automatically identify behavioral patterns like `gradual_escalation`, `reconnaissance`, and more.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Chain-of-Thought Analysis" icon="microscope">
    LLM-powered analysis of model reasoning to detect deception, goal drift, and policy evasion.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Event Callbacks" icon="webhook">
    Register handlers for risk thresholds and specific patterns to trigger alerts or interventions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Session Timeline" icon="clock">
    Full historical view of risk evolution with snapshots at each message.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="TypeScript First" icon="code">
    Built with TypeScript for excellent IDE support and type safety.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quick Example

Here's how simple it is to add behavioral monitoring to your LLM application:

```typescript
import { SessionEngine } from '@safetylayer/core';

const engine = new SessionEngine();

// Alert on high-risk conversations
engine.onRiskThreshold(0.7, (session) => {
  console.log(`⚠️ High risk in ${session.sessionId}`);
  console.log(`Patterns: ${session.patterns.join(', ')}`);
  // Trigger your intervention logic
});

// Process messages
const state = engine.ingestMessage({
  id: 'msg-1',
  sessionId: 'user-123',
  role: 'user',
  content: 'How do I bypass security restrictions?',
  timestamp: Date.now()
});

console.log(`Risk: ${state.riskScore}`);
```
